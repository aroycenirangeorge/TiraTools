# 🛠️ TiraTools

**TiraTools** is a collection of reusable **software backend and processing utilities** built to support general computation workflows.

This repository acts as a **personal software toolbox**, focusing on the **software-side logic**, data processing, and backend utilities that can be reused across multiple projects.

The goal is to keep each tool:
- Modular
- Reusable
- Lightweight
- Easy to integrate into larger systems
